# Welcome to your Magento 2 Challenge!
The purpose of this test is to prove your actual knowledge in Magento 2 platform and in code management software likie Git.

This test shouldn't take too long, actually 3 hours is more than enough to complete it, you're not going to be reinventing the wheel here or doing a fully functional site so don't be afraid if you aren't to complete the challenge.



## Take in mind the following hints

```
1. Do a Fork into your github account 
2. Clone the fork into your local environment and do the work there 
3. Once you want to push something do it against your fork, not the original repo
4. Keep a good track of commits so I will be able to review your overall performance and have a clear look of how you handled the challenge
5. Use the GIT versioning strategy (mostly for branchs like Develop and Feature/ branches)
6. Use Magento best practices, for example never modify core files, use plugins or extends when needed, use observers if needed, etc
```


## Challenge!
1. Install the magento in this repository and make it work
2. Install a custome template on it
3. Modify the minicart in the custom template to display the customer Name, Email and Address (only when customer is logged in)
4. Create a custom payment method named "consignacion"

4.1 Custom payment method must have  a configuration value named "Pasos para registrar pago"

4.2 The configuration value must be installed in the module configuration with any value you like just for testing purposes, for example "This is a test"
5. Custom payment method should be displayed in checkout 
6. Once custom payment method is selected in checkout the user must be able to enter their bank account details (Name, Number and Bank name) and these details must be stored in the Magento order, also the value of "pasos para registrar pago" must be visible before the form
